# Startup Quadrant Project

## Project Overview

You have been approached by a Venture Capital Fund to assist their Board of Directors in evaluating 1,000 startups for potential investment opportunities. The evaluation is based on three main criteria:

-- High Revenue (2015)

-- Low Expenses (2015)

-- Top Growth (2015)

This project uses Tableau to visualize the data and help identify startups that meet these criteria. The visualization is designed to enable the Board to make informed decisions efficiently.

## Key Features

1. Scatter Plot Visualization: "The Startup Quadrant"

*    The scatter plot represents startups with Revenue on the x-axis and Expenses on the y-axis.

*    The chart is divided into quadrants based on user-defined cutoffs for Revenue and Expenses.

*    Startups in the top-Right quadrant (high Revenue, low Expenses) are the most desirable investment opportunities.

2. Dynamic Filters

*    Revenue Cutoff: Adjustable slider to set a minimum revenue threshold.

*    Expenses Cutoff: Adjustable slider to set a maximum expenses threshold.

*    Group Leaders: Adjustable slider to filter the top-performing startups by growth.

3. Top 14 by Growth

*    A table displaying the top 14 startups based on growth percentage, with conditional formatting for easy identification of the best-performing startups.

# Steps to Run the Visualization

## Prerequisites

*    Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public

*    The dataset of 1,000 startups (P11-1000-Startups)

## Instructions

*    Load the Dataset:

*    Import the dataset into Tableau.

*    Set Up the Dashboard:

  Create the scatter plot visualization with Revenue and Expenses as axes.

## Add calculated fields for Growth and conditional formatting.

Configure Filters:

*    Add sliders for Revenue Cutoff, Expenses Cutoff, and Group Leaders.

## Design the Dashboard:

Combine all elements, including the scatter plot, sliders, and Top 14 Growth table, into a cohesive dashboard.

## Publish and Share:

Publish the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Public for access by stakeholders.

## How to Use the Dashboard

*    Adjust Filters:

Use the Revenue Cutoff and Expenses Cutoff sliders to refine the startups displayed on the scatter plot.

Use the Group Leaders slider to adjust the number of top-performing startups displayed in the table.

*    Hover for Details:

Hover over data points on the scatter plot to view detailed information about individual startups.

*    Identify Investment Opportunities:

Focus on startups in the top-Right quadrant of the scatter plot and the Top 14 by Growth list.

*    Insights and Recommendations

The dashboard provides clear insights into:

1. Which startups generate high revenue with low expenses.

2. The top-performing startups by growth percentage.

3. These insights will help the Board of Directors identify and prioritize the best investment opportunities.


## Future Enhancements

*    Add year-over-year comparison for growth trends.

*    Include industry segmentation for more targeted insights.

*    Integrate predictive analytics to forecast startup performance.
